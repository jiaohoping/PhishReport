# PhishReport
This plug-in for Microsoft Office Outlook allows users to forward suspicious e-mail (phishing, spam etc.) to a defined address to validate legitimacy. The person in charge of validation will receive a header and a copy of the original email.

The project also contains an example of a setup project for creating .MSI package.
